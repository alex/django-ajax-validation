Usage
=====

To use, Ajax Validation requires only that you add a URL(one per form), and some javascript to any page with the form.

Example:

forms.py:
    from django import newforms as forms
    
    class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField(label='Your Name')
        email = forms.EmailField(label='Your Email')
        message = forms.CharField(label='Your Message', widget=forms.Textarea)


You would need to add the following url to your urls.py(you need to import the form class):
    (r'^SOME/URL/$', 'ajax_validation.views.validate', {'form_class': ContactForm}, name='contact_form_validate')

And then in the template where you want to display the form(in the head):
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js"></script>
    {% load jquery_validation %}
    {% include_validation %}
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(function()    {
            $('#form').validate('{% url contact_form_validate %}', {type: 'ul'});
        });
    </script>

As you can see, you need to have jQuery for this to work(here it is being loaded
from google).  In the javascript you use jQuery's selectors to select where the 
form is, and the validate method takes 2 parameters, first is the URL of the 
validation, here we reverse the URL we set up earlier.  The second parameter is 
a dictionary, it is optional and should either provide type(ul, table, or p), 
this is the type of renderer you used for django's forms(form.as_p, etc.), the 
default is table if nothing is provided.  It can also take a callback option 
which is a function that recieves data, which is the JSON representation of any 
errors, and form, which is the jquery object that you provided.
